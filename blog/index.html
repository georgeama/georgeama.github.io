                    <p>As a child, my mom always told me to treat people the way I wanted to be treated. I listened but did not fully understand her words until I made a poor decision that profoundly hurt the feelings of a person I loved. 
                    </p>
                    <p>When I was seven years old, I was playing outside. It was a warm sunny day. I was building forts and jumping on our trampoline while my mom, dad, and family friend, Dale, were doing yard work. My mom and dad were hard workers and took pride in the appearance of our home, a quality that I always admired. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>My Mom Is The Best</h3>                  
                    
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add two (2) additional paragrahs of text and another level 3 heading. -->
                    <p>Dale found a garter snake in the driveway while pruning the hedge. He called me over to come and see it. I was ecstatic; I loved snakes. I asked my dad if I could keep it. He said that he didn’t care and I should ask my mom.</p>
                    <p>While holding the snake, I ran over to my mom; she was weeding the flower bed. She saw me holding the snake and backed away quickly. “Get that thing away from me!” she wailed. I moved back and asked, “Please, can I keep it?” She saw the look of excitement on my face. Against her wishes, she kindly said, "Yes, but it has to stay outside, and you have to promise to keep it away from me." I smiled and agreed.</p>
                    <h3>I am Scared of Snakes as an Adult</h3>                    
                    
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                    <p>I then collected a large tote, dirt, sticks, and leaves, everything I thought the snake needed to live. The snake kept me entertained for only a short while. As the day progressed, I found myself becoming bored with the snake. Without considering my mom's terms for keeping the snake, I had a brilliantly entertaining idea. I picked up the snake and proceeded over to my mom. She was still working on weeding the flower bed. I tapped her shoulder, and she stood up and looked at me. She glanced at the snake in my hand and noticed the devious look on my face. She roared, "Amanda! What did I tell you about that snake?"  She turned around and started running as I chased her with the snake. I thought it was hilarious. She ran towards my dad and hid behind him.</p>
                    <p>I knew I was in trouble when I heard my dad hollering my name. I put the snake down and began approaching my dad. I passed my mom as she walked to the house with tears dripping down her cheeks. Seeing my mom so sad immediately changed my attitude. When I reached my dad, he asked, “Why’d you chase your mama with that damn snake?” I looked at him but did not answer. He shook his head with disapproval and told me to ask her for forgiveness.
                    I found my mom and told her I was sorry, then I went to my room. I felt ashamed of my choices. I started thinking about how my mom always told me to treat people the way I wanted. I knew that I did not wish to be treated that way. So I decided to make it up to her by letting the snake go and sincerely apologizing. 
                        </p>
                    <p>After I said farewell to the snake, I went to find my mom. She was in the kitchen preparing dinner. I looked at her with sad puppy dog eyes and said, “I know that I would be sad, mad, and upset if someone were to do that to me. I am mad at myself. You are the best mom ever!” She put the spatula down, turned to me, and hugged me. She told me, “I am glad that you learned a valuable lesson today. Always, treat people the way you want to be treated.” She always had, and has, kind words of wisdom. 
                    Sometimes, making mistakes is the best way to learn. That day I learned a lesson and have held it dear to my heart ever since. "Treat people the way you want to be treated," also known as “The Golden Rule.”

                    <p>I hope that you enjoy the reading. The narrative essay is in the past tense and describes a situation that happened when I was a child. I had fun exploring old memories while constructing the outline and building the story. This reading should prove to be easily read, clear, and organized. It begins with a warm sunny summer day and follows a timeline throughout that day. It is intended to be a lesson learned by my seven-year-old self. <a class="expand" href="#"> &#x26AB;  &#x26AB;   &#x26AB;</a></p>

                    <img src="images/routine.jpg" alt="This assignment is taking forever!">
                    <p>I quickly felt burdened by the narrative; it was unorganized and chaotic. So, back to the drawing board, I went! I took two more days before I was satisfied with the outline. If I had more time to prepare the essay, I would have taken more time with editing. Gathering more opinions and edits from more readers would have built a more robust composition. <a class="expand" href="#"> &#x26AB;  &#x26AB;   &#x26AB;</p>

                    <img src="images/stag.jpg" alt="I hope this is the right picture">
                    <p>In my narrative, I try to prove "The Golden Rule" by describing a situation when I did not abide by it. I hurt their feelings by choosing not to treat my loved one the way I would want them to treat me. Seeing the look of devastation on that person's face crushed me. I was ashamed of my actions, and in turn, I learned to always treat people the way I want to be treated. <a class="expand" href="#"> &#x26AB;  &#x26AB;   &#x26AB;</p>
